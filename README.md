# NHANES Health Data Visualization App

This Shiny app allows users to interactively explore and visualize the NHANES dataset, a comprehensive health and nutrition data set from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Users can create customizable plots and filter data based on various variables, such as age, BMI, and gender.

## Features

- Choose variables for the X and Y axes from the NHANES dataset.
- Select between scatter plots or box plots for visualization.
- Customize plot aesthetics, including point size and color.
- Filter the dataset by gender.
- Automatically generated summary statistics for the selected variables.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have R installed on your machine along with the following packages:

```r
install.packages(c("shiny", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "NHANES", "RColorBrewer", "shinythemes", "shinycssloaders", "rlang"))
```

### Running the App

To run the app locally, you can clone this repository and run the following command in R:

```r
shiny::runApp("path_to_your_app_directory")
```

Alternatively, if you have the `app.R` file, you can launch the app by sourcing the file directly:

```r
source("app.R")
```

## Usage

Once the app is running, you can:

- **Select X and Y variables**: Use the dropdown menus to choose variables from the NHANES dataset.
- **Choose plot type**: Pick between a scatter plot or a box plot.
- **Customize point size and color**: Adjust the appearance of the plot.
- **Filter by gender**: Use the multi-select option to filter data by gender.
- **View summary statistics**: The app will display basic statistics (mean, standard deviation, min, max) for the selected X and Y variables.

## Example

Hereâ€™s an example of the app interface with a scatter plot of Age vs. BMI:

## Code Structure

- **UI**: The user interface is defined using the `fluidPage` layout, providing various input controls for customizing the plot and filtering the dataset.
- **Server**: The server logic handles reactive filtering of the NHANES dataset based on user input and generates dynamic plots and summary statistics.
